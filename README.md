BLON integration/staging tree
================================


What is BLON?
----------------

BLON is an new digital currency that enables instant payments to
anyone, anywhere in the world. BLON uses peer-to-peer technology to operate
with no central authority.

Development process
-------------------

Developers work in their own trees, then submit pull requests when they think
their feature or bug fix is ready.

If it is a simple/trivial/non-controversial change, then one of the BLON
development team members simply pulls it.

If it is a *more complicated or potentially controversial* change, then the patch
submitter will be asked to start a discussion (if they haven't already) on the
[mailing list](http://sourceforge.net/mailarchive/forum.php?forum_name=blon-development).

The patch will be accepted if there is broad consensus that it is a good thing.
Developers should expect to rework and resubmit patches if the code doesn't
match the project's coding conventions (see `doc/coding.md`) or are
controversial.

The `master` branch is regularly built and tested, but is not guaranteed to be
completely stable. [Tags](https://github.com/blon/blon/tags) are created
regularly to indicate new official, stable release versions of BLON.

Testing
-------

Testing and code review is the bottleneck for development; we get more pull
requests than we can review and test. Please be patient and help out, and
remember this is a security-critical project where any mistake might cost people
lots of money.


### Manual Quality Assurance (QA) Testing

Large changes should have a test plan, and should be tested by somebody other
than the developer who wrote the code.

See https://github.com/blon/QA/ for how to create a test plan.
